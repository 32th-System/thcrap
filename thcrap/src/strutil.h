  * Usually, the normal version with Unix-style forward slashes should be used, but there
  * are some cases which require the Windows one:
  *
  * - PathRemoveFileSpec is the only shlwapi function not to work with forward
  *   slashes, effectively chopping a path down to just the drive specifier
  *   (PathRemoveFileSpecU works as expected)
  * - In what is probably the weirdest bug I've ever encountered, th07
  *   _REQUIRES_ its launch path to have '\' instead of '/' - otherwise it...
  *   disables vsync.
  *   Yes, out of all sensible bugs there could have been, it had to be _this_.
  *   Amazing.
